## üìä Analytics & Monitoring
- **Usage analytics dashboard** - Track which tools/resources are used most
- **Performance metrics** - Response time graphs, throughput charts
- **Cost tracking** - Monitor API usage costs for servers that use paid services
- **Alert system** - Notifications for errors, high latency, or unusual activity
- **Request/response history** - Searchable history with replay capability
- **Session recording and playback** - Record entire MCP sessions for debugging

## üîê Security & Access Control
